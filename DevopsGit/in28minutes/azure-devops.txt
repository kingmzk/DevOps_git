Azure Devops Update: [error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted.
When executing an Azure Pipeline which needs parallel execution, you might receive this error!

[error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request



Here is the documentation from Azure DevOps about this error:

We have temporarily disabled the free grant of parallel jobs for public projects and for certain private projects in new organizations. However, you can request this grant by submitting a request. Existing organizations and projects are not affected. Please note that it takes us 2-3 business days to respond to your free tier requests.



I would recommend going ahead and submitting a request so that you can run parallel jobs in the subsequent steps!



Keep learning every day
